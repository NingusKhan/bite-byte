            <p>Bite & Byte is a group formed for a class project that wanted to create a product that allows users to easily search for recipes and the ingredients needed to make cooking as seamless as possible. Future plans for this project include an AI system that the user could use to scan their refrigerator for ingredients in order to give recipe suggestions. This would save the user time and prevent food waste.</p>
